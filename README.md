# Player Experience Information Evaluation in 3D Virtual Environments

Developed with Unity 3D engine.

How to evaluate the information when the user experience the 3D scene.

There are two scenes in the user study application.

The first one is used for verifying the effectiveness of our method. The participant is asked to find out digits scatted in the scene, and input them after pressing ESC key.

The second one is a mini RPG game scene. The participant is asked to explore the scene freely. Player experience information will be calculated using our method proposed in the paper.

The value of experience information along with other necessary user behaviour data will be saved into a file located in the folder named Output under the folder of Exe_Data.

The exctue appliaction, the Bartleâ€™s taxonomy application, and more results can be download from the cloud [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r_knmdVb4JgEEuprA4ZYsw).
